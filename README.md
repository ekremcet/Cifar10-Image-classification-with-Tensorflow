# Cifar10 image classificiation with Tensorflow
:information_source: Models are designed with **500.000** hidden parameter limit
<br>
:information_source: Achieved accuracy is **71.58%** _(top1 prediction)_ with **170 iterations** using first model 
<br>
<br>
:large_blue_diamond: Check **Trainer.ipynb** for more information about models
<br>
:large_blue_diamond: McNemar test is used for comparing two models in the evaluation part. You can check the results in **evaulator.ipynb**
